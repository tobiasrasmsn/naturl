# Naturl ðŸ”—ðŸŒ³

Naturl is a simple, efficient URL shortener designed with simplicity in mind. Easily shorten URLs without the hassle of creating an account, and enjoy features like instant clipboard copy and custom short codes.

## Features

-   **No Login Required**: Shorten URLs instantly without the need to create an account.
-   **Instant Clipboard Copy**: Shortened URLs are automatically copied to your clipboard for immediate use.
-   **Duplicate Prevention**: If a URL has been shortened before, Naturl will provide the existing short URL instead of creating a new one.
-   **Custom Short Codes**: Optionally specify your own short code for easy-to-remember URLs.
-   **Database Transactions**: Ensures data consistency and prevents race conditions.

## How It Works

1. Enter a long URL into the input field.
2. (Optional) Enter a custom short code.
3. Click the "Shorten" button.
4. The shortened URL is automatically copied to your clipboard.
5. Use and share your shortened URL!

## Getting Started

To run Naturl locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tobiasrasmsn/naturl.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd naturl`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Set up your PostgreSQL database:
    - We recommend using [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for easy setup and management of PostgreSQL databases.
    - Create a new project on Neon and obtain your database connection string.
5. Set up your environment variables:
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
    - Add the following variables:
        ```
        DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string
        ```
6. Set up your database table:
    - Connect to your Neon database using your preferred SQL client.
    - Run the following SQL command to create the necessary table:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE urls (
          id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
          original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
          short_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
          created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
          is_custom BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
        );
        ```
7. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
8. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Note: Make sure to replace `your_neon_database_connection_string` with the actual connection string from your Neon database.
